      # Cache the installation of Poetry itself, e.g. the next step. This prevents the workflow
      # from installing Poetry every time, which can be slow. Note the use of the Poetry version
      # number in the cache key, and the "-0" suffix: this allows you to invalidate the cache
      # manually if/when you want to upgrade Poetry, or if something goes wrong. This could be
      # mildly cleaner by using an environment variable, but I don't really care.
